/**
 * <p>
 * Base class for all Kiji Producers used to generate per-row derived
 * entity data.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h1>Lifecycle:</h1>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances are created using ReflectionUtils, so the {@link
 * org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration} is automagically set immediately after
 * instantiation with a call to setConf().  In order to initialize internal state
 * before any other methods are called, override the setConf() method.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * As a {@link KeyValueStoreClient}, KijiProducers will have access to all
 * stores defined by {@link KeyValueStoreClient#getRequiredStores()}. Readers for
 * these stores are surfaced in the setup(), produce(), and cleanup() methods
 * via the Context provided to each by calling {@link KijiContext#getStore(String)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Once the internal state is set, functions may be called in any order, except for
 * restrictions on setup(), produce(), and cleanup().
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * setup() will get called once at the beginning of the map phase, followed by
 * a call to produce() for each input row.  Once all of these produce()
 * calls have completed, cleanup() will be called exactly once.  It is possible
 * that this setup-produce-cleanup cycle may repeat any number of times.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A final guarantee is that setup(), produce(), and cleanup() will be called after
 * getDataRequest() and getOutputColumn() have each been called at least once.
 * </p>
