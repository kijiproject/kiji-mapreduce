/**
 * <p>A KeyValueStoreClient defines a mapping between store names and their
 * KeyValueStore implementations via the getRequiredStores() method.
 * When used in the Kiji framework, you may override these default implementations
 * at runtime with either MapReduceJobBuilder.withStore()
 * or MapReduceJobBuilder.withStoreBindingsFile().</p>
 *
 * <p>How the KeyValueStores are surfaced to a KeyValueStoreClient varies across
 * implementations; often {@link org.kiji.mapreduce.KijiContext#getStore(String)} is used within
 * methods that receive Context objects as arguments.
 * You <b>should not</b> open KeyValueStoreReaders directly by repeatedly calling {@link
 * #getRequiredStores()}. This will create a new store and reader each time, and the
 * reader may not be properly initialized to read, e.g., from the distributed cache.</p>
 *
 * <p> Look to the implementing class for details on how the class distinguishes betweeen
 * defining the store configurations you require and opening an initialized
 * {@link KeyValueStoreReader} implementation. For example, KijiProducer and KijiGatherer
 * classes can use the <code>getStore(String storeName)</code> method of the Context
 * object passed in as an argument to <code>produce()</code>, <code>gather()</code>, etc.
 * You should refer to the documentation for the API you are implementing against.</p>
 *
 * <p>If you are implementing your own
 * handler for data using MapReduce or other means "from scratch", you may want to use a
 * {@link KeyValueStoreReaderFactory} to deserialize a set of KeyValueStores from a
 * Configuration object.</p>
